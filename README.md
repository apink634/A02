Merge Conflict: A situation that occurs when Git cannot automatically reconcile competing changes made to the same part of a file in different branches.

Push: The action of sending your local, committed changes from your local repository up to the remote repository on GitHub.

Pull: The action of downloading changes from the remote repository and immediately merging them into your current local branch (a combination of fetch and merge).
